# Memory-Hierarchy-Design
Implemented a flexible cache and memory hierarchy simulator and used it to compare the performance, area, and energy of different memory hierarchy configurations. The cache uses the LRU replacement policy and write-back + write-allocate write policy. The cache is augmented with a prefetch unit using a stream buffer.
